went missing 300 yrs ago
12 years before the war

they kept peace and justice in tarios
sang the songs of their trials


Pykes bloodline runs from the mistblades

they hid the [[mistkeep]] before trying something

#### Open items-
##### Mystery location in the isle nexus
There is a sanded away location on the isle nexus map where there should not be anything at all

Lost to mortals
##### Missing lines of Mistblades
[[Garros]]

do not sail path lotheric?
Twenty final mistblades left their names in fear Engali would kill their blood lines

carved into the wall of mistblades quarters is the name **Pablo** written by a young hand, and then sanded away

great hall - a large beautiful fading but vivid mural on the ceiling, rolled nat 20 hist
- depicts a few scenes:
	- poorly armored warriors kneeling before a king
		- likely the Overking kelian the 2nd
			- was fair and kind 
			- 543 of the 3rd age was his rule
	- same group around mages and mist is channeling into them
	- same group in matching garb wearing the cloaks
		- several singing, having a trial at court

Could [[Von Yipp]] be part of the mistblades
