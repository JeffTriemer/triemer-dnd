### History

For many centuries, Tarios was a golden civilization of innovation, peace, and equality. But as time went by, the kingdom began to separate into more drastic class lines. The royal families were powerful mages and all nonroyal magic uses were forced to serve them by means of a collar. By the end of the 8th century, Tarios was a kingdom of tyrants that abused the poor and other races.

### Disbandment

Called the Man's Fall, Tarios was troubled with infighting between the successor after the Overking died in unforeseen circumstances. The 5 Kings and Queens engaged in internal fighting. Meanwhile, the high elves of Lotheric created an alliance between the dwarves, halfling, gnomes, wood elves, and mistreated humans to disband the Kingdom of Tarios which had grown to mistreat the other races. The fight lasted several years and the kingdom of Tarios was divided into many smaller countries led by the humans who rose up against the crown. The 5 houses were killed or forced into hiding.
