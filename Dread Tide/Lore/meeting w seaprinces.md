the claw hates nef prince, us too
- vargus behind nef prince
silver fox (fought this one)
- hooded fig behind him

mid aged woman dark hair in nobles clothing
- looks like red lady
- misty snake around her head
- gold king has snake around his head


missed some stuff
vote for reality fulcrum in the vault of tarios
zafire gave oath to staff of blemry to become a sea prince and 
nefarious prince walked out of the trial
evidence presented around the gold kind murder?
proposing a spell cast to gold king to dismiss memory change
silver fox said long live the dread tide and attacked
