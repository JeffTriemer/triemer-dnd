Heading south to a small hamlet that we found to be empty except for Samuel, the owner of a carriage store
- empty town bc some exhibition that Zam yipp is holding

Agreed to check in with Samuels  granddaughter

Either take steam road (train) or new carriage

Gormit reads a book
- ring of death or something?
	- about the ring that Bongo had found
- historical ledger linking mythical people to the ring
	- each one is a famous assassin
	- another link btw people is that each of the people had kill counts over 50
	- appearance of the ring is unclear

We see some kind of creature letting out a bloodcurdling scream,
- hybrid btw giant bird and giant lizard comes down on a muskox and uses tentacles to suck up a giant monster? Just watched
