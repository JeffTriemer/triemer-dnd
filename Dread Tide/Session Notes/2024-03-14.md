teleported to heartland
center of the scarlet brotherhood
old capital of tarios

we ended up in a fully functioning tower, strange since other circles were destroyed

the tower was a trading company that didnt trade anything and recieved gold from '**house carsalenta**'

vulnerable to radiant damage and resistant to poison and necrotic

otw back to heartland we notice a bunch of poor human folk

pyke recalls that heartland after the fall of man was taken over by the elves that put in place a council of various people to watch over the town.

city has old walls and infrastructure, the southern side has been rebuilt the most

there are a bunch of gates
with giant crumbling statues

#### Legend lore
Engali was in love with an elf, didnt want to die before her, so he went to [[orcus]] for immortality
- could that elf be one of the [[Mistblades of tarios]]?
- [ ] **Pyke needs to find more info on the mistblades**
	- [ ] Varla Medric - Grandmaster of the Mistblades
	- [ ] Carlantha or Loraline Dusksong

#### Tannath - City of Hubris
the capitol city
someone tells [[Pyke]] about [[humble tavern, grinning fool]]
engali the fifth, yanis the first statues crumbled

###  Pyke goes to tavern
I pass some humans in the western parts of the city
make it pass an old main road and broken gate that would have left towards the left and the wooden bridge spanning the chasm

on either side of the bridge are guards

### Obery listens in on guards

they're saying everything is shit, but luckily they caught the blue phantom
**blue phantom's execution is tomorrow???**
- mass murder and serial killing of elves
- pic kinda looks like my disguise from when engali saw us? 

the guards are told to be quiet by another human guard, if you're pissed just let it all out at the [[phoenix carsalenta]] feast next week?

## pyke heads back
guards grouping up on some shackled human people

lead elf says 'i know one of you knows about the sacking of my fathers tomb, this is a high crime. the hero of this city deserves to rest in peace'
- he resembles, [[sol vicil]]
	- male leader of the fall of man, 

someone is rabble rousing the masses?
discrimination was not always the case, used to be fair for 2-3 centuries


today is 17th, [[phoenix carsalenta]] leaves town the 18th, then comes back and holds a feast on the 19th
