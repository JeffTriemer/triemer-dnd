Dream

	mirrors with different version of me
		all of what i could be
	the world is breaking if those on death win there will be no memories
		prevent
	loss of loved ones
	memory of child first steps
	memory of daughters wedding
	all memories of loss imaginable travel trhough soul and manifest in my
	wake clutching shamisen
	the symbol of lady of loss is inscribed in handle
	boon of memory

bongo must kill the queen of engali, speaks to the sea prince wagging their tongue

Red lady greater restoration 
- greater restoration
- you changed my memory
- fears me
