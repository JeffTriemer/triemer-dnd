Pyke and [[Zafire]] chase down the last goblin from last weeks combat
Bongo gets a word of advice from the fragrant one
- ***Take the mist and put it in the globe - the mistblades await the return?***

Gormit wakes up in a cage, where Cal is thrown in with him
- he spends an entire night digging away at stones while bound
- as the sun rises he sees he is at a lake with a platform built over it and a large tree that is dying with some flowers on it 
- the goblins have a T rex

Bongo, Pyke, Oberyn and Zafire wake up from a long rest
Oberyn scouts ahead using some nature tree shit and sees someone waiting for us
we go to them
- fine clothing, hat, burned away hair
- wearing a porcelain mask
- evidence of it covering inflamed skin
- covered well in clothes despite the heat
- falcio- the nefarious prince
	- he told us he had cal and gormit
	- does a stone child bleed grey?
	- every prince has a great strength?
	- he expects to be put in a trial by combat
		- he gives us a chance to hand over our key and stay out of his way or he will kill us
		- threatens the claw, seems to think he will die
	- just ask the fox why the circus exists
