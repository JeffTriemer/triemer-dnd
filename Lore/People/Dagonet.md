Full name is Dagonet Banil.

Dagonet is a weird guy that we met during [[Train Heist]]. He has noticed the #hecale people in [[The Party]], so [[Flip Reebes]] decided to keep him close during the mission. He is capable of decent #Tech, and has shown the ability to disable cameras.

Was oddly focused on "testing" [[The Party]] during the [[Train Heist]]. He tried to intentionally call the guards and jeopardize our mission. After we talked him down, we finished the mission successfully before a bomb that Dagonet had secretly placed on the train triggered. Dagonet had not posted any obvious motivation for this, but he was obviously taking credit for the attack with the evidence left behind.

Dagonet was revealed to be a serial arsonist/rioter named Weighted Snow. Weighted Snow is well known for the mask they use during fights.
