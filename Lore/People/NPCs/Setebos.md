known #female #Hecale #alien
Scaly Alien
Crime Boss
Seems professional, and powerful
Needs a lot of moisture

She is trading #hecale infused magic items in her criminal operation. She wants to bring these powers to those who cannot use them on their own. 

Used to be a partner with [[Mayor Gawaine Banil]] before the mayor betrayed her and reported her as a #hecale. The grudge is still strong, as [[Setebos]] has informants in [[Partil]] feeding her info about [[Mayor Gawaine Banil|Gawaine]]. It seems that her old coupling mask and weapon are now being used by Gawaine's son [[Dagonet]].
