Full name is Dagonet Banil.

Weird #human #male #terrorist we met during [[Train Heist]]. He has noticed the hecale people in [[The Party]], so [[Flip Reebes]] decided to keep him close during the mission. He is capable of decent #Tech, and has shown the ability to disable cameras. #leet #haxorz

He was slightly uncooperative during the mission, but decided to interrupt on a whim to 'see how capable we are.' Eventually, he listened to [[Vim]] who had told him to see how capable we are, he should observe our mission. He seemed to respect this.

Once we got off the [[Train Heist]], it seems like Dagonet was responsible for [[The Partil Rail Attack]] along with potentially [[Weighted Snow]]
