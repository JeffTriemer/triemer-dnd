Pier is the most technologically advanced planet in the system. This is a byproduct of all the research required to terraform the planet. Multiple ozone-emitting pillars build a thick atmosphere that is resilient to the harsh rays of the start Sirius. This provides the insulation necessary to host life and humanity on the planet.
