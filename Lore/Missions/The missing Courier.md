## Details
The [[Other/TTRPG/SW5e/triemerdnd/Lore/Missions/Train Heist|Train Heist]] was necessary because [[Setebos]]'s package was not successfully delivered by her courier, [[Iod]]. She would like to know what happened to put it on that train.

The reward for finding this intel will be #hecale cuffs that appear to give various additional powers. This might be contingent on completing another mission given along with this one, [[Find the Train Heist's purpose]].
