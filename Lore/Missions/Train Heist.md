## Details
This mission was offered by [[Setebos]]. The reward will be 1000 credits, and 7 days of rations for all five members of [[The Party]]. In addition, we are provided comm links and 250 credits to execute the mission with.
### Rules
1. Infiltrate the 7 pm train 312 going to [[Partil]]
2. Locate and extract a specific container
3. Do not be loud
4. Do not kill anyone
## Results
We succeeded in extracting the container. However, while leaving, train 312 exploded due to a bomb that [[Dagonet]] had placed before [[The Party]] had boarded. It's likely this noise will bring attention to [[The Party]] by association later. After retuning the container to [[Setebos]], she reveals the container to be full of illegal #hecale magic items.
