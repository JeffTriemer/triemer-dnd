# [[Setebos]]

- A #female #alien #callys, Hecalic Surge Detected. #hecale
- Local vigilante, has done efforts against the police, not much against Purgers, she wants to be hidden.
- Manufacturer of [[Couplings]]. Seems very knowledgeable of them, worthwhile to steal some to know how they are made. Potential interrogation required.
- Seems to receive packages from some manufacturer in [[Pier]], no knowledge on who it comes from.
- Close to [[Trete]], often has the people in the orphanage run errands for her. Primarily the transportation of contraband.
- Has worked to undermine [[Bearer Sorlina]] in the past. Put a hit on [[Bodyguard Frenic]], though unsuccessful.
- Potentially has a #rat in the police force in [[Reuse]]. Have already told [[Chief Brogua]] to keep an eye out.
- Has unknown informant in [[Partil]], intercepted messages are almost exclusively information on the [[Mayor Gawaine Banil]]'s movements. Potential connection? Follow-Up later.
- Not much else done in [[Partil]], no trade, no control.
- No actions or informants in [[Brend]].
- Once [[Iod]]'s container was stolen she immediately surmised where it would be taken and had a crew steal it back. Check future shipments for trackers. Or check the [[Couplings]] for some innate tracking device.
- The rest that follows is a spattering of information about her habits and where she goes where she is not working.
# [[Flip Reebes]]

- Seemingly afraid of everything, has cowered away from heist member [[Ajax]] multiple times. #coward
- Potential gambling weakness, spent hours in a park gambling with strangers.
- Specific Hecalic abilities is unknown, very cautious in showing them.
- Seems to be native to [[Pier]], his presence increases likelihood of escaped [[Henrick]] and [[Blondie]] being on Pier.
- [[Ferdinand]] had no information on him. Never met.
- No known history of crime.
- Stuck with [[Setebos]] after their [[Train Heist|heist on the train]].
# [[Vim]]
- [[Anthorhizome]], Hecalic Surge Detected. #hecale
- Young for a [[Anthorhizome]].
- No clear connection to the [[Anthorhizome]] it was reproduced from.
- Great strength for stealth operations.
- The most malnourished of the group, notable browning on leaves.
- Native to Pier.
- Appears adept at breaking into systems, hacked into the [[Actel Transportation|Actel]] train system.
- Seems to be the most approachable of the group. Potentially a little naive.
# [[Ajax]]
- A male #zabrak #alien, no [[Hecalia]] detected
- Physically intimidating. He knows this, very intimidating.
- Not native to Pier, has a used Ship docked with [[Actel Transportation]] Port with the mechanic [[Onsper]].
- Ship is currently out of commission, seems to be accumulating funds to repair it.
- Ship seems to be from a [[Cable]] moon, usage unknown, seems to be made to transport something.

- Suspected to be another [[Dr. Kim]] project.
- Avid user of #tech, has assisted in multiple hacking operations.
- Hides their identity with a cloak to varying success.
- Marked for no [[Hecalia]] usage, but there was an odd error in [[Hecalia]] Scanner when used. Taken as Evidence of [[Dr. Kim]]'s influence. Likely given sentience through [[Hecalia]] like [[Praid]].
- Held no aversion to crime, has likely had a past of it if [[Dr. Kim]] suspicion is valid.
- Seemingly native to [[Pier]].
# [[Ardolus]]
- A human male, no [[Hecalia]] detected.
- Not from [[Pier]].
- Seems rebellious, dangerous.
- Likely from [[Statio]], potentially participated in the rebellion years ago.
- Gathered information from a worker at a bar. Good at blending in.
- Seems the most against the state, could corrupt the others.
- I have deemed him the most dangerous for his potential connections to the [[Statio Rebellion]] and his apparent skill.
- Gave a description to a local mercenary for potential assassination.
# [[Purger Movement]]

The ship "[[Hollow Point]]" arrives with [[Head Purger Maddox]] within a week, plans to contact [[Agent CC]]. I am made to continue survey of [[Setebos]] and the new crew that seems to now be rooming with her. Must maintain no contact. [[Iod]] has given no new information, the boy is certainly a #hecale, however. He thinks I do not know. The prototype seems to be working well, will inform [[Head Purger Maddox]] to make more if possible.

[[Head Purger Maddox|Maddox]] coming down to do oversight on the [[KG Project]]. The [[The Partil Rail Attack|recent terrorist attack]] will be upsetting to him, [[Actel Transportation|Actel]] is working on a way to get him to [[Partil]] with replacement parts.

His presence will require greater supervision on the streets, going to talk to [[Chief Brogua]] to start a manhunt for [[Weighted Snow]]. Potentially of [[Setebos]] and [[The Party]] as, well.

Thankfully, the damage done to [[Bearer Sorlina]] and her [[Bodyguard Frenic]] were minimal, they will be discharged shortly. Will likely join [[Head Purger Maddox|Maddox]] in [[Partil]] when they recover.

If everything goes well we are on track to activate the [[Lighthouse]] in [[Partil]] within months .

The good opus be done.
