Short Black hair down to shoulders, lots of freckles, pale skin

[[Pit Junior High]] sophmore student

Sweet girl that lost her memory in a fall in [[St Sucro Basillica]]
- her friends don't seem to really recognize her since the incident, like she's suddenly hard to relate to



She was a rebel that liked to smoke with [[Francis Selmore]] and [[Seth Detsom]] before something happened in the [[St Sucro Basillica]] that made her lose her memory and suddenly act differently

Was the subject of a mind swap procedure in the depths of [[St Sucro Basillica]] with [[Gus Becker]]

Has a crush on [[Joey Feld]], but he goes to a different school :( !!
