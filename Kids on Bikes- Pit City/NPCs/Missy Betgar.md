#npc #Group5SucroBasillica 
A girl who went missing after an incident in [[St Sucro Basillica]]

She Returns to [[Pit city]] after being missing for 40+ years, strangely the same age, and its the same date as when she left! Plus years, but same date!

She doesn't remember much, but she knows she is on the [[Cheer team]] and you **will not** stop her from cheering [[The Toads]] on

She entered [[Another Dimension]] in the [[St Sucro Basillica]] on [[Homecoming]] night and got out as quickly as she could, but did not age appropriately for the 40+ years
- she went to [[Homecoming]] as friends with [[Gary Dicti]] and [[Frank Selmore]]
