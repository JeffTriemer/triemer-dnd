VM is secretly virtual machine, some one created [[Anthorhizomes]] and can remotely access them.
# Background
Working with [[Maddox]] and [[Purgers]] for wages to pay for food
###### Tabba
In a chest pocket in my combat suit, I hold a worn hand written letter from an admirer from my childhood index (VM)
###### OG character request
```
I would like to be a relatively young, unassuming, kind, sentient, carnivorous fern cyborg with complex human neurotypical design including state of the art pain receptors that can be remotely accessed by a godlike intelligence that genetically created our race.


Please note, that if it pleases the court, instead of a godlike artificial intelligence, I could also be remotely accessed by any sentient creature with the correct credentials as determined by the lovely government, or perhaps even a dungeon master, to do their bidding. Also, if robotic components such as arms and legs are not suitable, this can be reskinned as scientifically fictitious strong foilage sprouting as my arms and legs as I was genetically modified to have.
```


## My mission

##### **"Get information about the Reebes Family's location from the people you will be working with"**
Maddox would have sent a messenger Purger to you, he is not currently on Pier. The messenger tells you to try and get in on a heist that a known Hecale in the region, [[Setebos]], is about to perform. 

Maddox does not care about the actual heist, Setebos is considered a non-threat to him. But **one of the people planned to perform this heist holds potential information on the location of some dangerous Hecales**. Get close, get the information. You are looking for information on the "[[Reebes]]" family's location. Maddox will find you after some time to check in.
