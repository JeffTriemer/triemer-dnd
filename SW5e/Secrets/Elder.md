They are granted the most respect by the #vim people because of their age and therefore advanced maturity. This is in part due to the continued development of vims his mental abilies, even at 321 years of age! 

![[Vim#Vims Culture]]

As the Eldest Vim by more than 50 years, a great amount of intrigue and mystique follows them as they are capable of feats as a  #Hecale that others cannot imagine, including deception, which is an ability vims only have against other vims that are significantly younger and therefore less developed than them.
