##### Worldbuilding
[[Robots]] are not considered sentient and are tools to be used

[[Partil]] is mostly made up of manufactuing, built around a pillar, its smaller than [[Pier]]

### How do we secure the package?

Tensions rise with [[Dagonet Banil]] as [[Ajax]] attempts to intimidate him

We have to figure out how to remove this pelican case from a pallet without triggering the bots..
- [[Vim]] with [[Bungle]]'s help attempts to remove the pack without setting off alarms
	- Success! Vim is able to use his vine like limbs to nimbly remove the package

[[Dagonet Banil]] attempts to set off the security to 'see our worth'
- [[Vim]] is able to talk him down, - 'hey, if you want to see what we're worth, notice that we are carrying out this missing without raising any alarms!! This is what we are worth'

Afterwards, [[The Party]] walks to the next cart. Inside is a first class crew and a guard. [[Vim]] tells the guard that we're inspecting the cart while keeping an eye on our two tagalongs, [[Dagonet Banil]] and [[Flip Reebes]]

### The train comes to a stop
[[The Party]] gets off the train [[Vim]] thanks the guard and excuses himself to the guests. Everyone appears to be unnoticed as we leave the station, separate from [[Flip Reebes]] and [[Dagonet Banil]], since they don't have our security credentials.

After we leave the station, [[Dagonet Banil]] calls after [[Flip Reebes]] as he starts to run away. 

# **Then the station blows up.**

[[Vim]] runs into the station, transforms into a police and tells everyone to calm down and evacuate and then is able to slice into the train's terminal and remove any trace of [[The Party]] from their records.

As [[Vim]] runs back to the group, he directs the arriving officers, telling people what needs to be done to help. [[Ajax]] hides the box and sits and watches the train, [[Ardolus]] stealth's away from the explosion. [[Bungle]] disguises as an officer and walks away. [[Flip Reebes]], the #coward, runs away for his life.

[[Ajax]] notices that it seems like folks from the later carts survived the explosion.

# We make it back to [[Setebos]]
[[Vim]] wants her to know that [[The Party]] did not set off the explosion. She shares that [[Weighted Snow]] was responsible for some bank attack. She opens the package and shows that it has some extra spell slot stuff in there. 

We are rewarded, 7 rations and 200 credits each

[[Setebos]] doesn't disagree with [[Weighted Snow]]'s [[The Partil Rail Attack]], they seem to empathize with the frustrations.

[[Setebos]] mentions she was surprised that [[Flip Reebes]] wasn't useful, since he is from the well known [[Reebes]] family

Upon [[The Party]] pushing for more rewards due to the high profile nature of the job, [[Setebos]] offers a place to stay, along with some additional meals in the coming days
# LEVEL UP!!
