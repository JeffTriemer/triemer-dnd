## Worldbuilding Notes

- GM clarifies that robots are not sentient. Destroying robots has no positive or negative connotation without more context. [[Vim]] is not a robot.
- They city of [[Partil]] is built on a [[the Pillars|pillar]]. It was a former manufacturing hub on pier before [[The Collapse of Space Travel| the collapse]]. [[Reuse]] also used to be central hub of exports on [[Pier]]. The first train stop is still in [[Reuse]]  
## Argument Back in the Storage Car

[[Vim]] and [[Bungle]] disable the alarms that are preventing use from moving the target. While this is going on [[Dagonet]] begins making a ruckus. He keeps talking about "testing us" He attempts to intentionally trigger an alarm in the room, but [[Ajax]] and [[Ardolus]] prevent him by grappling him. It's clear from his dexterity checks that he is very skilled. We finally convince him to calm down by communicating that our ability to finish this mission with no alarm is a good enough test. A considerable amount of time was spent discussing on if we should just kill him or not. Flip did successfully get him to flinch with his fist during these discussions. Who is the real #coward?

## Arriving at the station

After leaving the storage car, we successfully avoid suspicion as we take seats in the last passenger car. After a few minutes pass, we reach the station and leave the train in two groups. The first group is the four members of the [[The Party]] that had logs documenting them as security auditors. The second group is [[Flip Reebes|Flip]] and [[Dagonet]]. Flip is terrified of being alone with this strange person that is aware of his #hecale powers. The second Flip feels like he is out of sight, he begins to run away. [[Dagonet]] calls back "Hey, Flip!" At that exact moment, the caboose of train 312 explodes. Flip commits to escaping him and the fresh fireball, and he leaves without responding.

 [[Dagonet]] had placed a bomb in that first car. [[Ardolus]]'s insurgent past helps him recognize [[Dagonet]] as an infamous serial arsonist/rioter named [[Dagonet|Weighted Snow]]. This explosion alerts the entire platform. People begin screaming and running while the local guards begin responding to the situation. [[The Party]] uses these moments to blend further into the chaos:
- [[Ardolus]] hides himself near the target container
- [[Ajax]] hides the target by blending it in with other luggage. He sits comfortably to enjoy the chaos.
- [[Vim]] blends in to the populace by giving helpful commands to people.
- [[Bungle]] disguises himself as an officer uses his fake position to leave quietly.
- [[Flip Reebes|Flip]] runs for his life. It's clearly suspicious. #coward

## Collecting Reward

We make it back to [[Setebos]] and explain the details. She reveals that the package contains #hecale magic items, like a watch she briefly shows [[Bungle]]. It could of given him more #tech powers. Despite the attention [[Dagonet]] brought us, [[Setebos]] agrees to to give more jobs to [[The Party]]. We'll need more food soon anyway.

##### Worldbuilding
[[Robots]] are not considered sentient and are tools to be used

[[Partil]] is mostly made up of manufactuing, built around a pillar, its smaller than [[Pier]]

### How do we secure the package?

Tensions rise with [[Dagonet]] as [[Ajax]] attempts to intimidate him

We have to figure out how to remove this pelican case from a pallet without triggering the bots..
- [[Vim]] with [[Bungle]]'s help attempts to remove the pack without setting off alarms
	- Success! Vim is able to use his vine like limbs to nimbly remove the package

[[Dagonet]] attempts to set off the security to 'see our worth'
- [[Vim]] is able to talk him down, - 'hey, if you want to see what we're worth, notice that we are carrying out this missing without raising any alarms!! This is what we are worth'

Afterwards, [[The Party]] walks to the next cart. Inside is a first class crew and a guard. [[Vim]] tells the guard that we're inspecting the cart while keeping an eye on our two tagalongs, [[Dagonet]] and [[Flip Reebes]]

### The train comes to a stop
[[The Party]] gets off the train [[Vim]] thanks the guard and excuses himself to the guests. Everyone appears to be unnoticed as we leave the station, separate from [[Flip Reebes]] and [[Dagonet]], since they don't have our security credentials.

After we leave the station, [[Dagonet]] calls after [[Flip Reebes]] as he starts to run away. 

# **Then the station blows up.**
![[station explosion.png]]

[[Vim]] runs into the station, transforms into a police and tells everyone to calm down and evacuate and then is able to slice into the train's terminal and remove any trace of [[The Party]] from their records.

As [[Vim]] runs back to the group, he directs the arriving officers, telling people what needs to be done to help. [[Ajax]] hides the box and sits and watches the train, [[Ardolus]] stealth's away from the explosion. [[Bungle]] disguises as an officer and walks away. [[Flip Reebes]], the #coward, runs away for his life.

[[Ajax]] notices that it seems like folks from the later carts survived the explosion.

# We make it back to [[Setebos]]
[[Vim]] wants her to know that [[The Party]] did not set off the explosion. She shares that [[Weighted Snow]] was responsible for some bank attack. She opens the package and shows that it has some extra spell slot stuff in there. 

```
We are rewarded, 7 rations and 200 credits each
```

[[Setebos]] doesn't disagree with [[Weighted Snow]]'s [[The Partil Rail Attack]], they seem to empathize with the frustrations.

[[Setebos]] mentions she was surprised that [[Flip Reebes]] wasn't useful, since he is from the well known [[Reebes]] family.

Upon [[The Party]] pushing for more rewards due to the high profile nature of the job, [[Setebos]] offers a place to stay, along with some additional meals in the coming days.
