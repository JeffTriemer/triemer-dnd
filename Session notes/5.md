### Infiltrate the [[Purger]] hideout
[[Vim]] and [[Bungle]] infiltrate the top floor of the building and hack into the security system. We're able to unlock the doors, and attempt to sneak down. We notice there is only one part of the building left without cameras on the first floor, in a back corner near the purger.
### Things start to heat up
While attempting to sneak down to the first floor, [[Vim]] and [[Bungle]] raise a bit of alarm making some noise. Over the comms, they call for backup and [[Ajax]] charges in through the front and starts tearing a room apart. [[Ardolus]] immediately sneaks in a drops a bot, while [[Flip Reebes]] slowly approaches the party, #coward. [[Vim]] overzealously charges in and with a surge of violet light explodes between two bots before getting immediately headshot and dropping.

[[Bungle]] rushes in with supporting damage while [[Ardolus]] and [[Ajax]] push forward. The support allows [[Flip Reebes]] to reach [[Vim]] and heal him up. 

Now its just this [[Purger]]...
