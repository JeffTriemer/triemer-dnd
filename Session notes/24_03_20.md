## Notes at start
Reminders from GM at the start about the [[Train Heist]]:
- [[Setebos]] asked us to not kill anyone.
- The train is going to [[Partil]]. 
- There are metal detectors before the train. 
## Morning decisions
[[Flip Reebes]] hands his lightblade to [[Ajax]]. He doesn't want to be holding it when they board and get scanned. Before the [[Train Heist|heist]], [[Vim]] wants to hack the transportation system to get advanced permissions on the train. After a extended excursion at the guard station at the train terminal, [[Vim]] and [[Bungle]] use their #hecale and #tech powers to get to an access point. They give all of the [[The Party]] weapons access on the train except for [[Flip Reebes]]. During this excursion, [[Ardolus]] questions locals about the trains at the #Carlion bar. He learns about some of the guards' behaviors and bathroom situations on trains from a man called [[Bo'rid]]. The train is operated by a company called [[Actel Transportation]]. [[Ajax]] and [[Flip Reebes]] spend this time playing some chance cubes. [[Flip Reebes]] regrets this  ( #coward ). He luckily loses the game, but is scarred by the thought of what [[Ajax]] would of done if he won. 

## World building
GM decides the year is 20,086, and the planet uses the Gregorian calendar.
Tickets were bought for us for train 312.
6 hours pass before the 7 PM train arrives. We eat some kebab to pass the time.

## Mission Start
We get on the train with a bunch of people. We supposedly have been provided comm links, but no one has used them yet. After we board, Vim has convinced the guards on board that the hacked accounts belong to an auditing security force. They begin to move from the train behind the engine car towards the freight car. [[The Party]] has to communicate to a guard to get past. 

During this discussion, [[Vim]] uses #hecale powers. Unfortunately, a shady interloper named [[Dagonet]] notices. [[Flip Reebes]] perceives this, and makes sure to keep [[Dagonet]] under surveillance. [[Vim]] demands that [[Flip Reebes]] and [[Dagonet]] have to come with him and the other auditors. [[The Party]] makes their way to the freight car which is full of advanced security measures like cameras, robots, and turrets. For some reason, [[Dagonet]] decides to help, and shows us that he can use #tech powers to disable the cameras. We soon spot the target container, but the session ends before we make a decision about how to extract it from the freight car, or the train.

#### Recap
We met doing the [[Train Heist]], 
- [[Flip Reebes]] seems very suspicious, like he doesn't really do crime. what is making him take the dip?
## Off to the station
![[sci fi train.png]]
We're looking for a terminal into the station where i can hack us into the permissions to board with weapons

Vim sneaks into a back groom with [[Bungle]] at [[Actel Transportation]]

[[Ardolus]] meets some guy named [[Bo'rid]]
- he basically learns some of the security details for the train
- he mentions [[Partil]] the place the train is going is 'okay'

[[Vim]] and [[Bungle]] get a security cam watcher person to report to their boss in the lobby, saying hes really pissed this time
- Vim jacks into the computer with his vine like limbs extending into the PC and creates credentials for [[Train Heist]] as independent security auditing contractors

[[Ajax]] and [[Flip Reebes]] do some gambling

Then we all get kebabs
## Time for a heist
Everyone gets in cart 312

[[Flip Reebes]] gets on with a normal ticket, while everyone else gets on with the new credentials [[Vim]] got as independent contractors

### Finding the package
We're able to pass all the guards to the cart with the package without any trouble, as [[Flip Reebes]] has us take a shady crime friend along with us.

#### Our shady friend appears useful..
- As we get nearer to the package, the presence of cameras increases drastically, and our shady crime friend helps disable them with tech power. 
	- What is this persons name?
	- He said he just did some crime of his own
	- He appears to notice that [[Vim]] and [[Flip Reebes]] are #Hecale but does not seem to object.

#### The package is under protection of mechanized weaponry and bots
**How the hell is the party supposed to take the package?****
