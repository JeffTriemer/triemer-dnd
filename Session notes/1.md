# A train heist

[[Setebos]] is a humanoid giving a job for this heist

[[Bungle]] sets up his hood 
- ive done crime like youve done turtlenecks
[[Flip Reebes]] walks in and asks the robot, 'is this the crime room?'
[[Ajax]] black and red darth maul mother fucker 8 ft tall runs in and looks like he could kill death
[[Ardolus]] does stuff


Vim enters [[Setebos]]'s off skipping
[[Setebos]] asks us to catch a train for its goods
who will we be taking the goods from?
- They're held in an empty compartment
- fragile but not too fragile?
- don't kill anyone...

We spend the rest of the session arguing.
