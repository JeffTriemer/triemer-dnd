	Vim is told by Maddox to take a train heist job and gather info on the Reebes family, the fixer, Setebos gathers a group of willing individuals. Which is supposed to have intel that Vim needs?

## Off to the station
![[sci fi train.png]]
We're looking for a terminal into the station where i can hack us into the permissions to board with weapons

Vim sneaks into a back groom with [[Bungle]] at [[Actel Transportation]]

[[Ardolus]] meets some guy named [[Bo'rid]]
- he basically learns some of the security details for the train
- he mentions [[partel]] the place the train is going is 'okay'

[[Vim]] and [[Bungle]] get a security cam watcher person to report to their boss in the lobby, saying hes really pissed this time
- Vim jacks into the computer with his vine like limbs extending into the PC and creates credentials for [[Train Heist]] as independent security contractors

[[Ajax]] and [[Flip Reebes]] do some gambling

Then we all get kebabs
## Time for a heist
Everyone gets in cart 312

[[Flip Reebes]] gets on with a normal ticket, while everyone else gets on with the new credentials [[Vim]] got as independent contractors

### Finding the package
We're able to pass all the guards to the cart with the package without any trouble, as [[Flip Reebes]] has us take a shady crime friend along with us.

#### Our shady friend appears useful..
- As we get nearer to the package, the presence of cameras increases drastically, and our shady crime friend helps disable them with tech power. 
	- What is this persons name?
	- He said he just did some crime of his own
	- He appears to notice that [[Vim]] and [[Flip Reebes]] are #Hecale but does not seem to object.
