# We Start back in combat

The driods are mostly dismantled, but the purger is still fresh.

We end the fight by putting the mandolorian to sleep and then beating up all the droids.
Vim gets the Purger's dossier. Hes been tracking us. Vim keeps all the new info to himself, but bungle notices he takes some data. Ajax pockets all the credits off the purger, but ardolus notices. They share some criminal nods. 

Flip asks ajax to get all the info about Iod out of the purger. Flip triess to learn the purgers name to help humanize him, but ajaz plugs his ears. He wants to be violent. Ajax gets real scary and demands the precise info on Iod's info. 

We learn that the lever for the door is updateneath some stuff behind the desk. Flip was afraid of the lever as a trap but it actually opened the door, wherer Iod was.

Iod is beat up and tied up. Flip asks ajax to ask for more detail on how the hecale cuffs ended up on the train. Sending to partil for experiments. Another purger. Logan is the tied up purger. Setebos asked to kill him, but flip is against. 

I vaguely remember the person named ferdinand in the docs we get from the purger.

Brend is SE of Reuse, no informants there
setebos has contact with Mayor Gawaine Banil (relative to dagonet) in partil


We start driving back with ardolus at the wheel. Flip starts asking about Iod questsions. Iod doesn't know much about Dagonet. Iod was gonna give the partil. Puck was the target for couplings, and he was coming down from partil. Puck might not be safe. Puck normally a courier back to forth in partil. We deliver Iod back to trete. 

setebos: You know his name!?

logan: I crushed his trachea!


Lighthouse in partil : This is a running advertising campaign to reestablish space travel in partil. This lighthouse is realted to the  KG project.  


Maddox -> head purger

Brogue -> reuse police chief

Frenic is sorlina bodybuard

Sorlina -> bearer or pier, queen basically. 

I think that dagonet is stopping transit to stop people organzing to partil. Ardolus is gonna use his insurgent connections. We need to meet people in the starting actel train station. 

Our next plan:

1. get info from rebels that might be meeting up at the train station
2. Flip wants to leave Reuse. They are searching for all the party, and all the leads point there.
