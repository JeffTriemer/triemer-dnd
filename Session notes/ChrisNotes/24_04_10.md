## The infiltration starts

Bungle scales the wall towards the security room with a grappling hook. Vim takes a hoop out and uses his light dagger (on a chain) to cut a hole in the window. Purple light saber. 

Bungle and Vim are disguised as maintenance workers and the begin searching inside. They find a bunch of weird monitors. They do some #leet #haxorz shit. They do not find [[Iod]] on the cameras.

They surmise that s missing room from the cameras is on the first floor. Somewhere towards the back.  They spot the #purger on the first floor in the garage area. There's a bunch of bots.

## Time to make a splash

The infiltration team gets noticed, so they request a distraction. [[Ajax]] bursts into the first floor and combat begins. 

[[Ardolus]] blows up a droid. Vim rushes into the #purger's office and makes a play with his #hecale powers, but it fails and he goes down when droids rush him. [[Ajax]] and [[Ardolus]] go on a crit spree and mash up these droids supporting the #purger.[[Flip Reebes]] uses his own #hecale powers to heal [[Vim]] back up.  We end the sesssion with most of the droids totaled, but the #purger basically untouched.
